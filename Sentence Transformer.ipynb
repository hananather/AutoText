    "##  Elasticsearch & Approximate Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "Elasticsearch has the possibility to index dense vectors and to use them for document scoring. We can easily index embedding vectors, store other data alongside our vectors and, most importantly, efficiently retrieve relevant entries using approximate nearest neighbor search (HNSW, see also below) on the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Searching a large corpus with millions of embeddings can be time-consuming if exact nearest neighbor search is used (like it is used by util.semantic_search).\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) can be helpful. Here, the data is partitioned into smaller fractions of similar embeddings. This index can be searched efficiently and the embeddings with the highest similarity (the nearest neighbors) can be retrieved within milliseconds, even if you have millions of vectors. However, the results are not necessarily exact. It is possible that some vectors with high similarity will be missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all ANN methods, there are usually one or more parameters to tune that determine the recall-speed trade-off. If you want the highest speed, you have a high chance of missing hits. If you want high recall, the search speed decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three popular libraries for approximate nearest neighbor are Annoy, FAISS, and hnswlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieve & Re-Rank\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex semantic search scenarios, a two-stage retrieve & re-rank pipeline is advisable:\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:33e87363-fea0-4138-8d68-28df6b695990.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a search query, we first use a retrieval system that retrieves a large list of e.g. 100 possible hits which are potentially relevant for the query. For the retrieval, we can use either lexical search, e.g. with a vector engine like Elasticsearch, or we can use dense retrieval with a bi-encoder. However, the retrieval system might retrieve documents that are not that relevant for the search query. Hence, in a second stage, we use a re-ranker based on a cross-encoder that scores the relevancy of all candidates for the given search query. The output will be a ranked list of hits we can present to the user.\n",
